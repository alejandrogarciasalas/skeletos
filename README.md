# skeletos
_Skeletos means skeleton in greek_ 

a fairly simple boilerplate for small quick projects

Skeletos is basically  a predefined folder structure + [Skeleton boilerplate](http://getskeleton.com/) divided into sass files + the automation we want from Gulp

[I](https://github.com/alejandrogarciasalas) recommend using this boilerplate only for small projects (a single landing page etc.)
